Overview

Welcome to the Amazon.com Clone project! This front-end web development endeavor aims to replicate the iconic Amazon.com homepage using HTML and CSS. By embarking on this project, we demonstrate our web development prowess and attention to detail, closely mimicking Amazon's design to create an authentic user experience.

Key Features

Responsive Design: Our Amazon.com clone is designed to seamlessly adapt to various screen sizes and devices, ensuring that users enjoy a consistent experience.

HTML and CSS: We've exclusively used HTML and CSS for this project, keeping it lightweight and easy for anyone to understand and modify.

Amazon-like Layout: We've painstakingly recreated Amazon's homepage layout, including the navigation bar, product cards, and footer, staying true to the original site's structure.

Custom Styling: While adhering to Amazon's design, we've also infused our creativity into certain elements, such as **fonts, colors, and interactive hover effects.
